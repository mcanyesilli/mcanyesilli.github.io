I am a third year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering Department of Michigan State University. My research topic is on data-driven analysis of complex dynamical systems. I combine machine learning with tools from Topological Data Analysis to create new investigative methods to study dynamical systems. I also study how learned models perform when applied to data that differs from the training setâ€”a concept called transfer learning.
