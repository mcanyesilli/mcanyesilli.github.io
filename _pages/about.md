I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Michigan State University in May 2022. 
I combine machine learning with tools from Topological Data Analysis to create new investigative methods to study time series and image data. 
I also study how learned models perform when applied to data that differs from the training setâ€”a concept called transfer learning.
